# Dublin Core Application Profile (DCAP)
### Revisiting the Singapore Framework....

The [Singapore Framework](http://dublincore.org/documents/singapore-framework/) was a pioneering attempt to formalise the creation of metadata application profiles and can be considered to have been 'ahead of its time'. With a growing mainstream interest in developing and managing metadata profiles in a wide variety of contexts, the time has come to revisit this framework and to address, in particular, one component - the *Description Set Profile*.

The goal of this project is to make the DSP *actionable*.

The project will build on a considerable body of prior art - much of which is documented on the DCMI website. In some cases, copies of resources from that website have been added to this repository for convenience.

The requirements for the Actionable DSP are being gathered and [documented here](requirements.md).
