title: Application Profiles IG
date: 2002-10-18
description: |-
  The concept of the *metadata application profile* is important for DCMI and the Dublin Core community. It has underpinned many of DCMI's development efforts in recent years - not least of which the [Singapore Framework](/specifications/dublin-core/singapore-framework/). More examples of work in this area can be seen in the [list of Dublin Core specifications](/specifications/dublin-core/). There is significant community interest in developing tools to aid in creating, documenting and validating application profiles. This DCMI Interest Group will provide a supported venue for discussion on this topic, as well as providing a logical 'home' for some development activity which is likely to include:

  * Revising the [Dublin Core Abstract Model (DCAM)](/specifications/dublin-core/abstract-model/) to describe the basic structure of description sets and how that relates to RDF
  * Creating a minimal [Description Set Profile (DSP)](/specifications/dublin-core/dc-dsp/) that covers the basic structure of description sets as 'shapes' using the revised DCAM
  * Revising the [Singapore Framework](/specifications/dublin-core/singapore-framework/), to adopt the revised DCAM elements and to include the validation of 'shapes'.
  * Developing some 'best practices' and patterns for the development of application profiles
