2019-03-15 Informal chat about Application Profiles

Attended: Tom, Nishad, Karen, Harold, Andra, Eric

Harold: Biolink model.  Interested whether my work is applicable.

Ultimate goal of Biomedical Data Translator.  Enable new discoveries.  They are making Linked Data work!  At recent meeting, presentation of "tidbits": things recently discovered that could not have been discovered without Linked Open Data.  Discoveries related to disease treatments - within one week!

https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine team: Knowledge Graphs in form of (attributed) reified triples.  Put together in coherent enough ways that reasoners can traverse arcs and discover new pathways.  On high level.

I got involved at lower level - https://github.com/biolink - combination of API for Knowledge Graphs and Biolink model.  Typical: use a very different style of software development: they go out and, with agile idiom: throw out just enough to work.  Relatively empty test directories.  They asked: Can you put into ShEx?

Model https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model - Nodes, Edges, Predicates.  "Association" class: you have a subject, relation, object.

Class: variant-to-disease association - this is what they asked me to put into ShEx.  A metamodel and a [model built from metamodel].  I have separated the metamodel from the model itself.  Model is working pretty well and I need to incorporate the metamodel into it.

Shows https://github.com/biolink/biolinkml/blob/master/notebooks/examples.ipynb . 
https://mybinder.org/ - turns a Git repo into a collection of interactive notebooks.  Builds a docker container, launches a Jupyter notebook.

Model itself is documented in https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model/blob/master/biolink-model.yaml

This is built on Python, so uses Python types.  Capricious coloring scheme. YAML magic Github repo.  Defined classes.  Modeled in YAML.  This is the more readable choice for this community.  
I pull the YAML in.  Uses Python 3.7 Data Class.  We are using Yuml package - can emit a UML rendering of the model.  Then we can take the model, as defined above, and emit a JSON-LD context for the model.  Prefixes declared.  Defaults.  This community does alot of SPARQL and Graph-QL.  YAML model description: use ShEx generator to create ShEx equivalent.

In ShEx, you can label collections of triple expressions.  "Does subject ../notebooks/42 conform to Person (shape)?"

Going into actual code https://github.com/biolink/biolinkml/blob/master/notebooks/examples.ipynb - model source is YAML.  Firing up Binder.  This YAML modeling language is not graph-specific, in fact more GraphQL and Neo4J, but works with ShEx.  Could give us an approachable modeling language for ShEx.  Also a GraphVIZ output.

Andra: Diego from European Research Council is also exploring YAML => ShEx.  Might make sense to introduce you two.  

CAUTION: If you edit a Binder image, they stayed in the Binder context - until I tried submitting them to Github.  Had to copy-paste the new changes.  Nothing in the interface that tells you you are running binder.

Harold shows: 
    values_from:
      - IMEX
      - BioGrid

We are generating GraphQL and ShEx.

Karen: I am interested in how you express constraints in YAML.

Harold: example 'emit_prefixes'. For cardinality, we just say "multivalue" True or False.  There will be a slot called 'id_prefixes'.  I cut this model to everything needed to model itself, now adding in features to meet requirements, trying to keep simple.

ShEx generator is at https://github.com/biolink/biolinkml/blob/master/biolinkml/generators/shexgen.py .

Harold: Oops - meeting at 10 - must leave!

Tom: http://dublincore.org/documents/profile-guidelines/ - uses improvised syntax that looks like Harold's YAML.

Karen: First we need to define a vocabulary for a profile, then can start defining profiles.  
https://github.com/kcoyle/RDF-AP/blob/master/schemaList.csv - turning this into YAML would be very useful - then we can figure out how that YAML becomes ShEx.  We have the problem: it is fairly simple to talk about key-value pairs.  More complicated if you want to talk about dependencies between those pairs.  But easier to do in YAML than in spreadsheets or CSV.  YAML solution looks better.  What we need to do now: start with the incredibly simple vocabulary for defining profiles and start experimenting with that.  As we get into it will see that DSP did not solve certain problems.  The fact that Harold has gone from YAML to ShEx is very encouraging.

Nishad: I started to work in CSV - https://metabridge.jp/infolib/metabridge/menu/ - Sugimoto and Nagamori - see https://metabridge.jp/infolib/metabridge/menu/?lang=en

My idea: create application profiles - the simple DSP syntax is _too_ simple.  But what the tool does: define some DSP examples. 

https://metabridge.jp/infolib/metabridge/show/description/view/?lang=en&descriptionURI=http%3A%2F%2Fmdlab.slis.tsukuba.ac.jp%2Fschema%2Fdmm - will lead to an actual page with DSP.  Original CSV.  The CSV is an application profile.  Can be used to generate RDFS and OWL.

Karen: I have a spreadsheet in my Github directory - compares DSP with other approaches.  Would be great to put 

Nishad: http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000132512.pdf - the model documentation, scroll down to see SimpleDSP - to section 6.2.5.  Table 16 on page 76 - define datatypes.  

Karen: One of our targets should be CSV for the most basic. Then YAML, more expressive.

Nishad: YAML proved to be more straightforward.  Problem with CSV (or even with RDF AP): all have to go through some logical () to build the structure.  DPLA using Google spreadsheets, then generate PDF from that - no machine-actionable formats so far.  Main problem: if you want to cover full Singapore Framework.  Preprocessing workflow to generate all formats.  TXT2DSP slides from 2007 - used a simplified text.  

Pete Johnston's http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/pubs/article/view/836/832 

Also the MoinMoin wiki syntax - http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dsp-wiki-syntax (will become active in next week or two)

Nishad: I made my own YAML (YAMA = Yet Another Metadata Application...) - based on, closely follows DC models.  Want to generate human-friendly documentation from that model.

Karen: Want to see how DSP is expressed in YAMA.  Let me suggest way to begin: 
* start with simplified version of [DSP](http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-dsp/) and get that going so we can create names of things, cardinalities, types
* then look at how that could move into ShEx.

DSP does not give you the full business rules.  But if we get simple description first, then can...

Eric: Like the way people fall back to HTML when they use Markdown (because they need more).

Karen: Having basic profile will be great unifier for building community around requirements.  It's the thing we don't have: a basic vocabulary for expressing profiles.
Can we have a strawman by September?  Doesn't have to be perfect.  Something for people to hack on.

Nishad: Can write up as paper for DC-2019.
