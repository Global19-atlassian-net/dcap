## Agenda

### Review minimalist profile(s)

1. https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/tree/master/prototypes/simpleFromHackathon
2. https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/tree/master/prototypes/wikidata_painting

RESOLVED: That the most minimal profile could consist of a list of properties.
Because we resolved earlier that URIs are not required, a separate property label" would not be required. (We questioned this later.)

ACTION: To develop definitions for the elements of the simple profile model (as a document in Github).  (Tom will give John and Alexis access to the repository.) Karen will create initial document.

John: If a profile has just a list of properties, how is it different from a vocabulary? (Tom will ask this on the list.)

### Comparison

**Elements**

|[no 1]( https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/tree/master/prototypes/simpleFromHackathon) | [no 2](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/blob/master/prototypes/wikidata_painting/E130b.csv)
| --- | --- 
|Entity_name|Entity_name|
|Entity_label|Entity_label|
|Statement_ID| |
|Property|Property|
|Property_Label|Property_label|
|Cardinality|Mand|
||Repeat|
||Value|
Value_type|Value_type|
Annotation|Annotation|

**Simplest**
This is just a list of properties with optional labels
|element|
|----|
|Property|
|Property_Label

**Simpler**
This is for a profile that does not define entities, e.g. the profile is for a single entity. See some examples done for [ContentDM metadata](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/wiki/Related-Projects#contentdm).

### Questions

1. What is the simplest that a profile can be and still be a profile?
2. Can minimalist profile be the core of a more extensive profile template?
3. Can the "simple" be used as is, or are more properties needed?
5. Will we want to define URIs for these properties? Do we prefer to use existing DC (or other) terms or AP-specific? 
6. How to define namespaces within a tabular format?
7. How far do we want to take the value definitions? Include more, or leave to developers? What is the optimum "simple" for this?
8. Can value_type be expanded to include pick lists, URI stems? Or do we limit to standard value types?
9. What transformations can we add to our prototypes? 
11. Should we specifically develop a "ShEx-friendly" version? e.g. https://github.com/johnsamuelwrites/dcap/blob/master/ShExStatements/shexstatements.ipynb

### Resolved

1. Shall we complete this minimalist profile? RESOLVED: YES (Feb 18)
2. Do properties have to be URIs? (RESOLVED: no (Feb 18))
3. RESOLVED: Profile can be less than simple template (entities, properties, values).
