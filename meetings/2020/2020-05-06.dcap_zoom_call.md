### Discussion

Abstract model strawman:
"A profile can have one or more *entities*, each with one or more *statements*." 

Naming and defining:
* [Profile_Entity](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/issues/60)
  * Definition strawman: "A thing or concept that will be described by the profile."
  * Is the entity described on its own row? Does it have cardinality?
  * Column label: 
* [Property](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/issues/59)
  * Definition strawman: "The previously defined data element that can be used to describe an aspect of the entity."
  * Column label:
* [Statement](https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/issues/59#issuecomment-623471657)
  * Definition strawman: "The property and value constraints that describe an aspect of the entity."


(Note to kc self: to what does the annotation refer? The entire row? Some element in the row?)

## Minutes



### Open Questions

1. Can minimalist profile be the core of a more extensive profile template? (We seem to agree that it SHOULD.)
3. Can the "simple" be used as is, or are more properties needed? (Have we decided "as is"?)
5. Will we want to define URIs for these properties? Do we prefer to use existing DC (or other) terms or AP-specific? 
6. How to define namespaces within a tabular format?
7. How far do we want to take the value definitions? Include more, or leave to developers? What is the optimum "simple" for this? Would we want to include regex formulas in this column?
8. How will we handle multiple values in a single cell (e.g. a pick list of string values)?
9. Can valuetype be expanded to include pick lists, URI stems? Or do we limit to standard value types?
10. How can we include constraints for "recommended" and "mandatory if applicable"?
11. What transformations can we add to our prototypes? 
12. Should we specifically develop a "ShEx-friendly" version? e.g. https://github.com/johnsamuelwrites/dcap/blob/master/ShExStatements/shexstatements.ipynb
