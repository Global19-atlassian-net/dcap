# Simple template

These documents are for the simple profile that is being proposed. This is based on the template developed for the [Wikidata schema](/prototypes/wikidata_painting) prototype. This is very similar to the simple profile developed at the DCMI 2019 [Hackathon](/prototypes/simpleFromHackathon). 

This includes the [template](simpleTemplate.csv) and proposed [definitions](definitions.md).

There is an experimental [ShEx](shex4simple.txt) document that *might* express the simple profile in ShEx.
