Note, this is taken from the [University of Washington](https://www.lib.washington.edu/cams/mig/advice) ContentDM documentation. The fields below are only a selection from their metadata profile. Two of the data elements, "hidden" and "searchable" are not ones that we have considered in the past, but could be seen as elements of an application profile since they are application specific. The remaining two fields are "Big field" (which is a statement about the maximum size of the value) and "ControlVoc" (whether it takes a controlled vocabulary). Both of these are specifications about the value.
